# Developer's Guide

Welcome to the development reference for Camunda's Terraform EKS module! This document provides guidance on setting up a testing environment, running tests, and managing releases.

## Setting up Development Environment

To start developing or testing the EKS module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository from [camunda/camunda-tf-eks-module](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-tf-eks-module) to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to Test Suite:**
   - Go to the `test/src` directory to access the test suite.

3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Use the Test-Driven Development approach to iterate on the module.
   - Add or modify test cases in the test suite to match the desired functionality.
   - Run tests frequently to ensure changes meet requirements.

4. **Local Development:**
   - Utilize environment variables like `SKIP_XXX` to control certain behaviors during local development.
   - Ensure to use a unique identifier for the cluster to avoid conflicts with existing resources.

5. **Testing Tools:**
   - Refer to `test/README.md` for instructions on setting up and using testing tools.
   - Add fixtures and test cases using Terratest and Testify to validate module functionality.

6. **Cluster Cleanup:**
   - Set `CLEAN_CLUSTER_AT_THE_END=false` to prevent automatic cluster deletion in case of errors.
   - Optionally, manually clean up the cluster after testing by reversing this setting.

**Note**: Ensure that the "testing-allowed" label is added to a pull request to trigger the tests.
Then re-run this workflow by pushing a dummy commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger workflow"`.

You can skip specific tests in the CI by listing them in the commit description with the prefix `skip-tests:` (e.g.: `skip-tests: Test1,Test2`).

## Releasing a New Version

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) guidelines for versioning. Follow these steps to release a new version:

1. **Commit History:**
   - Maintain a clear commit history with explicit messages detailing additions and deletions.

2. **Versioning:**
   - Determine the appropriate version number based on the changes made since the last release.
   - Follow the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` as per Semantic Versioning guidelines.

3. **GitHub Releases:**
   - Publish the new version on GitHub Releases.
   - Tag the release with the version number and include release notes summarizing changes.

## Adding new GH actions

Please pin GitHub action, if you need you can use [pin-github-action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) cli tool.

By following these guidelines, we ensure smooth development iterations, robust testing practices, and clear version management for the Terraform EKS module. Happy coding!
